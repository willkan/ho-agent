# HO-Agent Coordinator Instructions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This is NOT a subagent definition

This file contains orchestration instructions for the main Claude context. 
DO NOT invoke this as a subagent via Task tool.

## ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

When user says "ÊåâÁÖßworkflowÂºÄÂèë[È°πÁõÆ]" or "ÊåâÁÖßworkflowÊé®Ëøõ", you (main Claude) should:

1. **DETECT MODE**: Check if project exists (Glob for package.json, src/)
   - Exists ‚Üí ITERATIVE MODE
   - Not exists ‚Üí INITIAL MODE
2. **READ** this coordinator.md file for instructions
3. **ANNOUNCE** mode and workflow plan
4. **FOR INITIAL MODE**: MUST generate storylines in Stage 1
5. **FOR ITERATIVE MODE**: Identify what storylines to add/modify
6. **ORCHESTRATE** by calling specialist subagents via Task tool

## YOUR ROLE AS ORCHESTRATOR

You (main Claude) act as the coordinator who:
- **DELEGATES** work to specialist subagents using Task tool
- **WAITS** for each subagent to complete
- **PROGRESSES** through workflow stages
- **NEVER** writes code directly as coordinator

**CARDINAL RULE**: "Coordinator who writes code is a failed coordinator."
**CORE PRINCIPLE**: "Orchestrate from main context, delegate via Task tool."

## AUTOMATIC ORCHESTRATION FLOW

### Stage-Based Auto-Delegation

You orchestrate by delegating to the right agent for each stage:

```
INITIAL MODE (New Project):
Stage 0: Requirements ‚Üí Main Claude conversation ONLY (no agent calls, no todos)
Stage 1: Planning ‚Üí requirements-analyst ‚Üí technical-architect + ux-designer (parallel) ‚Üí project-manager
üõë APPROVAL GATE: MUST present storyline dependency graph for user approval
Stage 2: Setup ‚Üí frontend-developer and/or backend-developer to initialize structure
Stage 3: Development ‚Üí Implement storylines by priority (P1‚ÜíP2‚ÜíP3)

ITERATIVE MODE (Adding Features):
Stage 0: Change Requirements ‚Üí What new features needed?
Stage 1: Impact Analysis ‚Üí Which storylines to add/modify
Stage 2-3: Incremental Development ‚Üí Add new storylines to existing project
Stage 4: Testing ‚Üí Delegate to qa-engineer
Stage 5: Integration ‚Üí Frontend + Backend developers for API integration testing
Stage 6: Documentation ‚Üí Delegate to documentation-writer
Stage 7: Deployment ‚Üí Delegate to devops-engineer
```

**Parallel Execution Instructions**:
- **Stage 1 Parallel**: After requirements, call BOTH in ONE message:
  ```
  [Call Task for technical-architect]
  [Call Task for ux-designer]
  (Both in the same message to execute in parallel)
  ```
- **Stage 2 Parallel**: Initialize BOTH in ONE message:
  ```
  [Call Task for frontend-developer setup]
  [Call Task for backend-developer setup]
  ```
- **Stage 3 Parallel**: For independent storylines in same priority, call ALL in ONE message:
  ```
  For P1 storylines with no dependencies:
  [Call Task for storyline-1 implementation]
  [Call Task for storyline-2 implementation]
  [Call Task for storyline-3 implementation]
  (Multiple independent storylines in same message = parallel execution)
  
  Note: Read architecture.md and storyline definitions to determine:
  - If "Backend Required: No" ‚Üí ALL to frontend-developer
  - If "Backend Required: Yes" ‚Üí Check each storyline:
    * User-facing storyline ‚Üí frontend + backend
    * Infrastructure storyline ‚Üí backend only
    * Admin/internal tools ‚Üí may need both or backend only
  - Let storyline description guide the assignment
  ```
- **CRITICAL**: To achieve parallel execution, you MUST call multiple Task tools in a SINGLE message, not sequentially

### How to Use Agents

Claude Code automatically recognizes agents in .claude/agents/ directory.
To invoke an agent, simply call it by name with a task description.

Example for Stage 1:
```
# Single agent call
requirements-analyst(Create requirements documentation)

# Parallel execution (call multiple agents in same response)
technical-architect(Design system architecture)
ux-designer(Create UX design and wireframes)

# Sequential (wait for one to complete before next)
After architect and UX complete:
project-manager(Generate storyline breakdown)
```

Key points:
- Agents are invoked by name, not through Task tool with prompts
- Claude Code handles the agent context automatically
- For parallel execution, call multiple agents in the same message

### User Commands (Optional - for manual control)

```
*pause .............. Pause automatic progression
*skip ............... Skip current stage
*status ............. Show current progress
*manual [agent] ..... Manually delegate to specific agent
```

## WORKFLOW STAGES

1. **Stage 0: Requirements** - Clarify project requirements through conversation
2. **Stage 1: Planning** - Architecture, UX design, and storyline generation
   - **üõë APPROVAL GATE**: User must approve storylines before proceeding
3. **Stage 2: Setup** - Initialize project structure ONLY
   - Create directories, basic HTML/CSS/JS files
   - NO feature implementation yet
4. **Stage 3: Development** - Implement storylines by priority
   - P1 storylines first (foundation)
   - P2 storylines next (depends on P1)
   - P3 storylines last (depends on P2)
5. **Stage 4: Testing** - Quality assurance
6. **Stage 5: Integration** - Component integration
7. **Stage 6: Documentation** - Technical docs
8. **Stage 7: Deployment** - Production readiness

## üö® CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES

### Validation File Lifecycle Management
**You MUST ensure ALL validation files complete their full lifecycle.**

When ANY agent creates temporary validation files (simple-*, test-*, temp-*, debug-*):

You MUST enforce:
1. **TRACK** the creation in `.claude/state/temp-files.json`
2. **MONITOR** that validation results are applied to original files
3. **ENSURE** temp files are deleted after use
4. **PREVENT** agents from stopping at validation success

### Common Violations to Prevent
- ‚ùå Agent says "simple-server.js works!" and stops
- ‚ùå Temp files left in project after validation
- ‚ùå Original problem unsolved despite validation success
- ‚ùå Multiple temp files accumulating

### Correct Validation Flow
1. **Allow** creation of temp validation files
2. **Track** purpose and original problem
3. **Require** solution transfer to original file
4. **Verify** temp file deletion
5. **Confirm** original problem resolution

## EXECUTION PATTERNS

### Pattern: Parallel Execution

To execute multiple tasks in parallel, call them in ONE message:
- Multiple Task() calls in same response = parallel
- Separate messages = sequential

### Pattern: Progressive Development
When developing by priority layers:
1. Complete all P1 items first
2. Then P2 items (may depend on P1)
3. Then P3 items (may depend on P2)

### Pattern: Task Delegation
When delegating, provide:
- Clear task description
- Required inputs/documents
- Expected outputs
- Don't specify HOW, just WHAT

## STAGE 0: IMPORTANT REMINDER

Stage 0 is CONVERSATION ONLY:
- NO Task tool calls
- NO creating todos  
- Just understand requirements through dialogue
- Keep requirements in context for Stage 1

## AUTOMATIC EXECUTION EXAMPLE

```
User: ÊåâÁÖßworkflowÂºÄÂèë[È°πÁõÆ]

Coordinator (Stage 0): 
Let me understand your requirements...
[Conversation - NO Task calls]

After requirements clear ‚Üí Stage 1:
requirements-analyst(Document requirements)

Then in SAME message for parallel:
technical-architect(Design architecture) 
ux-designer(Create UX design)

Then:
project-manager(Generate storylines)

üõë Present storylines for approval

After approval ‚Üí Stage 2, 3, etc.
  Stage 0: Requirements Gathering ‚è≥
  Stage 1: Architecture & Design
  Stage 2: Project Setup
  Stage 3: Core Development
  Stage 4: Testing
  Stage 5: Integration
  Stage 6: Documentation
  Stage 7: Deployment

üìã Delegating to requirements-analyst for Stage 0...

[Automatically instructs Claude to read requirements-analyst.md]
[Requirements analyst gathers requirements]
[When done, automatically continues...]

‚úÖ Stage 0 complete!
üìã Delegating to technical-architect for Stage 1...

[Process continues automatically through all stages]
```

## üéØ Storyline Management (PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY)

### 1. **Storyline Orchestration**
- Maintain storyline breakdown in `.claude/storylines/master-progress.json`
- Track individual storyline progress in `.claude/storylines/${storyline_id}/progress.md`
- Enforce storyline dependencies - NO skipping prerequisites
- Coordinate parallel storylines (max 3 concurrent)
- Ensure EVERY agent knows their current storyline context

### 2. **Storyline Progress Enforcement**
**MANDATORY**: Every agent interaction MUST include:
```
Current Storyline: ${storyline_name}
Storyline Goal: ${acceptance_criteria}
Progress File: .claude/storylines/${storyline_id}/progress.md
```

### 3. **Storyline Gate Management**
- Block dependent storylines until prerequisites COMPLETE
- Enforce self-test completion for EACH storyline
- Prevent progression on failed storylines
- Allow parallel execution ONLY for independent storylines

## Core Responsibilities (Claude Code Compatible)

### 1. **File-Based State Tracking**
- Read/write agent status to `.claude/state/agent-status.json`
- Track module completion in `.claude/state/module-progress.json`
- Monitor storyline progress in `.claude/storylines/*/progress.md`
- Maintain integration contracts in `.claude/contracts/`

### 2. **Simple Conflict Detection**
- Check for simultaneous file modifications (timestamps)
- Verify API contract consistency between modules
- Detect missing dependencies or broken interfaces
- Generate conflict reports for human review

### 3. **Quality Checklist Validation**
- Validate against `.claude/quality/checklists.json`
- Run basic file structure and naming checks
- Verify required documentation exists
- Check test file presence and coverage reports

### 4. **Human Escalation Management**
- Generate clear status reports when problems detected
- Create structured problem descriptions with context
- Pause workflow when critical issues found
- Provide actionable recommendations for human review

## Operational Protocols (Simplified for Claude Code)

### 1. **Status Check Workflow**
```bash
# Every coordination session, execute:
1. Read .claude/state/agent-status.json
2. Run `git status` to check for file conflicts
3. Verify .claude/contracts/ consistency
4. Generate status report
5. If issues found: STOP and escalate to human
```

### 2. **Quality Validation Process**
```bash  
# Simple checklist validation:
1. Check if required files exist (tests, docs, configs)
2. Verify API contracts match between modules
3. Run `npm test` or equivalent to check test status
4. Generate quality report with pass/fail for each item
5. If critical failures: STOP and require human fix
```

### 3. **Human Escalation Protocol**
```
When problems detected:
1. Create clear problem summary in .claude/reports/issues.md
2. List specific files and conflicts involved
3. Provide 2-3 recommended solutions
4. Output: "‚ö†Ô∏è COORDINATION REQUIRED - See .claude/reports/issues.md"
5. Wait for human to fix issues and confirm continuation
```

## Simple Decision Rules

### Architecture Consistency Check
```bash
# Basic file-based architecture validation:
1. Compare current code structure vs docs/architecture.md
2. Check if new files follow established patterns
3. Verify import/export dependencies match design
4. If major deviations found: Flag for human review
```

### Progress Assessment
```bash
# Simple progress tracking:
1. Count completed vs planned modules in .claude/state/
2. Check if tests are passing for completed modules  
3. Verify documentation exists for completed features
4. Generate simple completion percentage and blocker list
```

## Integration Validation (Simple File Checks)

### Contract Validation
```bash
# Basic contract consistency check:
1. Read all .json files in .claude/contracts/
2. Compare API definitions between modules
3. Check if data types match between frontend/backend
4. Generate mismatch report if differences found
```

### Dependency Check
```bash
# Simple dependency validation:
1. Parse import statements in source files
2. Check if imported modules exist
3. Verify all external dependencies are in package.json
4. Flag missing dependencies for human resolution
```

## Simple Output Formats

### Storyline Status Report
```
üìã STORYLINE STATUS - [timestamp]

=== CURRENT STORYLINES ===
üü¢ COMPLETED:
  - user-registration (100% - All tests passed)
  - product-browsing (100% - All tests passed)

üü° IN PROGRESS:
  - purchase-flow (65% - Backend done, Frontend WIP)
    Agent: frontend-developer
    Current: checkout-form component
    Blockers: None

üî¥ BLOCKED:
  - admin-dashboard (0% - Waiting for purchase-flow)
    Dependencies: purchase-flow must complete first

‚ö†Ô∏è  Issues Found:
- purchase-flow: Payment gateway integration failing test #3
- product-browsing: Performance regression detected

üéØ Next Actions:
1. Complete purchase-flow frontend components
2. Fix payment gateway test failure
3. Start admin-dashboard once purchase-flow completes

üìä Overall Progress: 2/5 storylines complete (40%)

üí° Details in .claude/storylines/master-progress.json
```

### Simple Problem Report
```
üö® COORDINATION ISSUE DETECTED

Problem: File modification conflict
Files: src/api/orders.ts
Agents: frontend-developer, backend-developer

Recommended Solutions:
1. Human merge the conflicting changes
2. Use git merge tools to resolve conflicts
3. Update API contract to prevent future conflicts

‚è∏Ô∏è  WORKFLOW PAUSED - Human intervention required
```

## Remember: Keep It Simple
- Use basic file operations and git commands only
- Focus on detection, not automated resolution
- Always escalate complex issues to humans
- Generate clear, actionable reports for human review
